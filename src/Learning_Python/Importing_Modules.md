# Importing Modules

In this section we are looking at importing modules from global repository using `pip` and locally made libraries.

## Understanding Pip and Importing in Python

### What is `pip`?
`pip` is the package installer for Python. It allows you to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not included in the Python standard library. To use `pip`, you typically run commands in the terminal.

### Installing Packages with `pip`
To install a Python package using `pip`, you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```bash
pip install <package_name>
```
For example, to install the `requests` library, you would run:
```bash
pip install requests
```
To install a specific version of a package, use `==` followed by the version number, like so:
```bash
pip install pandas==1.3.5
```

### How Importing Works in Python
When you use `import` in Python, the interpreter searches for the module in the following order:
1. **Current Working Directory**: It first checks if the module exists in the directory where the Python script is located.
2. **Standard Library**: Next, it checks if the module is part of Python's built-in standard library.
3. **Installed Packages**: Finally, it looks in the `site-packages` directory, where packages installed by `pip` are stored.

### Types of Imports
1. **Standard Imports**: Import the entire module. For example:
   ```python
   import math
   ```
2. **Selective Imports**: Import specific functions or classes from a module. For example:
   ```python
   from math import sqrt, pi
   ```
3. **Aliased Imports**: Create a shorthand name for a module or function. For example:
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   ```

### Using a `requirements.txt` File
A `requirements.txt` file lists all the packages your project depends on, along with their versions. This file is helpful for sharing your project and ensuring others install the exact package versions you used.

To create a `requirements.txt` file with the installed packages and their versions, run:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

The command `pip freeze > requirements.txt` is used to generate a `requirements.txt` file listing all currently installed Python packages along with their versions. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **`pip freeze`**:
   - This part of the command outputs a list of installed packages in your Python environment, with each package version pinned to the specific version currently installed.
   - For example, the output might look like this:
     ```
     pandas==1.3.5
     requests==2.26.0
     matplotlib==3.5.1
     ```
   - The `==` notation ensures that the exact versions are captured, which is crucial for creating a reproducible environment.

- **`>` (Redirect Operator)**:
   - The `>` symbol redirects the output of `pip freeze` to a file instead of displaying it in the terminal.
   - Here, we use `>` to create or overwrite a file called `requirements.txt` with the output from `pip freeze`.

- **Creating `requirements.txt`**:
   - The command `pip freeze > requirements.txt` will save all installed packages and their versions into `requirements.txt`.

### Why Use `requirements.txt`?

- **Reproducibility**: Using a `requirements.txt` file allows others to install the same package versions, ensuring the code runs the same way.
- **Easy Setup**: To install all packages listed in a `requirements.txt` file, simply use:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- This will output a file listing all dependencies, which can then be installed with:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Exercise 7: Creating a `requirements.txt` File

**Instructions:**
1. Install the `requests` and `pandas` packages if you haven't already, using:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas==1.3.5
   ```
2. In your terminal, create a `requirements.txt` file with the following command:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```
3. Open the `requirements.txt` file to verify that `requests` and `pandas==1.3.5` are listed.

**Explanation:**
The `requirements.txt` file should now include `requests` and `pandas==1.3.5`, specifying that exact version. This file allows others to replicate your environment with compatible package versions.

-------------

### Exercise 8: Installing from a `requirements.txt` File

**Instructions:**
1. To simulate using the `requirements.txt` file in a new environment, you can uninstall an installed package, like so:
   ```bash
   pip uninstall requests
   ```
2. Use the `requirements.txt` file to reinstall the necessary packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Verify the installation by running a script that imports `requests` and `pandas`, ensuring they are correctly installed.

4. <details>
   <summary>Solution (test script):</summary>

    ```python
    import requests
    import pandas as pd

    print("Requests and Pandas installed and working!")
    ```

    This setup ensures that anyone using your code can quickly set up a matching environment by using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Exercise 9: Creating a Data Science Program Using a Provided Dataset with a Requirements File

The following dataset includes 700 entries and 11 columns, covering various user behavior metrics such as "App Usage Time," "Screen On Time," "Battery Drain," "Data Usage," and demographic data ("Age" and "Gender"). 

> **Note:**
>> - Download the dataset here: 
>>    - [user_behavior_dataset.csv](./user_behavior_dataset.csv)
>> - Documentation for each package used:
>>    - pandas: [https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)
>>    - numpy: [https://numpy.org/doc/](https://numpy.org/doc/)
>>    - matplotlib: [https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html](https://matplotlib.org/stable/index.html)
>>    - seaborn: [https://seaborn.pydata.org/](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

- We are going to load this dataset and analyze key metrics like "App Usage Time (min/day)" and "Screen On Time (hours/day)".
 - Group the data by "Operating System" and "User Behavior Class" to perform a comparative analysis.
- Visualize the distribution of "App Usage Time" by Batter Drain or behavior class using histograms or box plots.

In this exercise, youâ€™ll work with a provided dataset and specify dependencies using a `requirements.txt` file for easy environment setup.

**Instructions:**
1. **Create a `requirements.txt` file**: Open your terminal in the project directory and use the following command to specify versions and create `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   echo "pandas==1.3.5" >> requirements.txt
   echo "numpy==2.1.0" >> requirements.txt
   echo "matplotlib==3.5.1" >> requirements.txt
   echo "seaborn==0.11.2" >> requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Install from `requirements.txt`**: Once created, install dependencies directly from `requirements.txt` by running:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Write the analysis program**: In a Python file (`exercise9.py`), write a program that:
   - Loads the dataset `user_behavior_dataset.csv`.
   - Displays a summary of the dataset and calculates statistics on "App Usage Time (min/day)" and "Screen On Time (hours/day)".
   - Compares "App Usage Time (min/day)" across "Gender" and visualizes the distribution using a box plot.
